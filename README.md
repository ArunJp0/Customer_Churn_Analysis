#Customer Churn Analysis â€“ EDA Project

#This repository contains my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python. The objective of this analysis is to understand the factors that influence customer churn in a telecom company.

#Overview
 - I have utilized Python along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, explore key patterns, and visualize important relationships.

#Key Steps Covered
 - Data cleaning and preprocessing
 - Handling missing values and data type conversions
 - Visual exploration using bar plots, pie charts, and stacked plots
 - Insights around churn behavior based on tenure, contract type, services used, and demographics

#Key Insights
 - 26.54% of the customers have churned
 - Month-to-month contract holders show higher churn compared to long-term contract users
 - Customers with fiber optic internet and no value-added services like OnlineSecurity or TechSupport tend to churn more
 - Churn is higher among new customers and senior citizens

#Tools Used
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Jupyter Notebook

#This project helped me build a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization using Python.
